## Aggregating and Grouping

![Aggregating and Grouping](../resources/AandG.JPG)

  - **Grouping:** Reduces the total number of rows down to a smaller group.
    - Done using the `GROUP BY` keyword
  - **Aggregates:** Reduces many values down to one.
    - Done by using *Aggregate* functions.

## Picturing GROUP BY

  - `GROUP BY` is always **two separate words**.
  - Will find all the unique values within a table.
  - Can only select those columns which you are grouping by.
  - Not very interesting on it's own, will become more useful once combined with aggregate functions.
